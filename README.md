# Redes Neuronales

Here is my repository for my projects of Neural Networks. 
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and function. 
They consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and learn from data, enabling tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making in machine learning
 Neural networks are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning models
